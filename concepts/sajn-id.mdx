# sajn ID - Identity Verification

sajn ID enables secure identity verification using Swedish BankID, allowing you to verify the identity of individuals before granting access to services or completing transactions.

## Overview

sajn ID provides two verification methods:

1. **SSN-based verification**: Verifies both identity and Swedish personal number (personnummer)
2. **Name-based verification**: Verifies identity and name match without requiring SSN

## How It Works

### Verification Lifecycle

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CREATED` | Verification created but not sent |
| `SENT` | Verification sent to recipient |
| `OPENED` | Recipient opened verification link |
| `VERIFIED` | Successfully verified |
| `FAILED` | Verification failed |
| `EXPIRED` | Verification link expired |
| `CANCELED` | Verification was canceled |

## Creating a Verification

### SSN-Based Verification

Verify both identity and SSN:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "reference": "customer_onboarding_123",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

### Name-Based Verification

Verify identity without SSN requirement:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "reference": "age_verification_456",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

## Delivery Channels

### EMAIL
Send verification link via email:

```json
{
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### SMS
Send verification link via SMS:

```json
{
  "channel": "SMS",
  "phone": "+46701234567"
}
```

## Verification Data

After successful verification, retrieve the BankID response data:

```json
{
  "id": "verify_123",
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "usedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "completionData": {
      "user": {
        "personalNumber": "197001011234",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "givenName": "John",
        "surname": "Doe"
      },
      "device": {
        "ipAddress": "192.0.2.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Sensitive information like SSN is encrypted and only accessible to authorized users.
</Note>

## Use Cases

### Customer Onboarding
Verify customer identity during account creation:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "reference": "account_signup",
  "note": "New customer registration",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

### Age Verification
Verify age without collecting SSN:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "reference": "age_check",
  "note": "18+ age verification",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

### Contract Signing Prerequisites
Verify identity before allowing document signing:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "contactId": "contact_123",
  "reference": "pre_signing_verification",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

## Linking to Contacts

Link verifications to existing contacts:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "contactId": "contact_123"
}
```

This creates an audit trail connecting the verification to the contact's profile.

## Audit Logs

Every verification includes a complete audit log:

```json
{
  "audits": [
    {
      "type": "ID_CREATED",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "type": "ID_SENT",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:01:00Z",
      "data": {
        "channel": "EMAIL"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ID_OPENED",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:15:00Z",
      "ipAddress": "192.0.2.1"
    },
    {
      "type": "ID_VERIFIED",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expiration

Verification links expire after a set period (default: 7 days). Set custom expiration:

```json
{
  "tokenExpiresAt": "2024-01-22T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## Billing

<Info>
  Creating a sajn ID verification counts toward your monthly sajn ID quota and is billed according to your plan.
</Info>

Each successful verification is tracked as a billable event, regardless of whether it completes successfully or fails.
