# Contacts

Contacts represent individuals that you frequently send documents to. Managing contacts makes it easier to create signers and track signing history.

## Creating Contacts

Create a contact with basic information:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+46701234567",
  "ssn": "197001011234"
}
```

### Contact Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `firstName` | Yes | Contact's first name |
| `lastName` | Yes | Contact's last name |
| `email` | No | Email address |
| `phone` | No | Phone number for SMS |
| `ssn` | No | Swedish personal number |
| `companyId` | No | Associated company ID |
| `companyRole` | No | Role within the company |
| `externalId` | No | Your system's identifier |

<Note>
  At least one of `email` or `phone` is recommended for sending documents.
</Note>

## Companies

Companies allow you to organize contacts by their organizations:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Corporation",
  "orgNumber": "556123-4567",
  "country": "Sweden"
}
```

### Linking Contacts to Companies

When creating or updating a contact, link them to a company:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@acme.com",
  "companyId": "company_123",
  "companyRole": "CEO"
}
```

## Using Contacts as Signers

When adding signers to documents, reference the contact ID:

```json
{
  "contactId": "contact_123",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "signingOrder": 1
}
```

The signer will automatically inherit information from the contact.

## Contact Management

### Searching Contacts

Use the API to search and filter contacts:

```bash
GET /api/v1/contacts?page=1&perPage=20
```

### Updating Contacts

```bash
PATCH /api/v1/contacts/{id}
```

<Info>
  Updating a contact doesn't affect existing document signers - changes only apply to new documents.
</Info>

### Deleting Contacts

Soft delete contacts to keep historical data intact:

```bash
DELETE /api/v1/contacts/{id}
```

Deleted contacts are hidden from lists but document references remain valid.

## Company Management

### Listing Companies

```bash
GET /api/v1/companies
```

### Getting Company Details

Retrieve a company with all associated contacts:

```bash
GET /api/v1/companies/{id}
```

Response includes:

```json
{
  "company": {
    "id": "company_123",
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "orgNumber": "556123-4567",
    "parties": [
      {
        "id": "contact_1",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## External IDs

Use external IDs to link contacts to records in your own systems:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "externalId": "customer_456"
}
```

This makes it easy to:
- Sync with your CRM
- Match contacts with your database records
- Integrate with existing workflows
