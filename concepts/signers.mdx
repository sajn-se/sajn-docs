# Signers

Signers are individuals who need to interact with a document. Each signer has a unique role and can track their progress through the signing process.

## Signer Types

Signers can be either individuals or companies:

### INDIVIDUAL
Regular person signing on their own behalf.

### COMPANY  
Company representative signing on behalf of their organization. Requires company information.

## Signer Roles

sajn supports four different signer roles:

### SIGNER
The primary role - must sign the document for it to be completed.

```json
{
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### ORGANIZER
The person who organized the document. Receives notifications but doesn't need to sign.

### REVIEWER
Reviews the document and can leave comments, but doesn't need to sign.

### ACCEPTOR
For acceptance-type documents - accepts rather than signs the document.

## Signer Information

Each signer has the following information:

```json
{
  "type": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+46701234567",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "signingOrder": 1,
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "DRAWING",
  "twoStepVerification": "NONE",
  "contactId": "contact_123"
}
```

For company signers:

```json
{
  "type": "COMPANY",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "companyName": "Acme Corp",
  "companyOrgNumber": "556123-4567",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "signingOrder": 1,
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
}
```

### Required Fields

- **type**: Signer type (`INDIVIDUAL` or `COMPANY`)
- **name**: Signer's full name
- Either **email** OR **phone** (depending on distribution method)
- **role**: Signer role (defaults to SIGNER)

For company signers, also required:
- **companyName**: Company name
- **companyOrgNumber**: Company organization number

### Optional Fields

- **phone**: For SMS notifications
- **ssn**: Swedish personal number (required for BankID signing)
- **contactId**: Link to existing contact in sajn
- **signingOrder**: Order for sequential signing

## Signing Order

When using sequential signing (`signingOrder: "SEQUENTIAL"`), assign each signer a number:

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "Manager",
      "email": "manager@company.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1,
      "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
      "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
    },
    {
      "name": "Employee",
      "email": "employee@company.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 2,
      "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
      "requiredSignature": "DRAWING"
    }
  ]
}
```

The manager must sign first before the employee can access the document.

<Note>
  For parallel signing, `signingOrder` is optional and will be ignored.
</Note>

## Delivery and Signature Settings

Each signer can have individual delivery and signature settings configured when adding them to a document.

### deliveryMethod

How the signer receives their signing invitation:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EMAIL` | Signing invitation sent via email (default) |
| `SMS` | Signing link sent via SMS (requires phone number) |
| `NONE` | No automatic delivery - retrieve signing URL manually |

### requiredSignature

The signature type required from this signer:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DRAWING` | Free-hand signature drawing (SES) |
| `BANKID` | Swedish BankID electronic signature (AES) - requires SSN |
| `CLICK_TO_SIGN` | Simple click-to-sign (SES) |
| `MANUAL` | For in-person signing |

### twoStepVerification

Additional verification before signing:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `NONE` | No additional verification (default) |
| `SMS_BEFORE_SIGNING` | SMS code required before signing |

<Tip>
  For SMS verification before signing, use `twoStepVerification: "SMS_BEFORE_SIGNING"` combined with your chosen signature type.
</Tip>

## Signer Status

Track each signer's progress through two status fields:

### Read Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NOT_OPENED` | Signer hasn't opened the document yet |
| `OPENED` | Signer opened the document |
| `READ` | Signer read the entire document |

### Signing Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NOT_SIGNED` | Signer hasn't signed yet |
| `SIGNED` | Signer has signed the document |
| `REJECTED` | Signer rejected the document |

## Retrieving Signing URLs

To get a signer's signing URL, call the get signer endpoint:

```bash
GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}/signers/{signerId}
```

Response includes the signing URL:

```json
{
  "id": "signer_123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "token": "abc123...",
  "signingUrl": "https://app.sajn.se/sign/doc_123?token=abc123..."
}
```

<Note>
  Each time you retrieve a signing URL, an audit log entry is created. Only fetch signing URLs when you need to share them with signers.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Never share signing URLs publicly. Each URL is tied to a specific signer and should only be sent to that individual.
</Warning>

## Linking Contacts

Signers are typically linked to contacts in your sajn account:

```json
{
  "contactId": "contact_123",
  "role": "SIGNER"
}
```

This automatically populates signer information from the contact and tracks signing history.

## BankID Integration

For BankID signatures, the signer must provide their Swedish personal number (SSN) and have `requiredSignature` set to `BANKID`:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
}
```

## Notifications

Signers receive notifications based on their individual `deliveryMethod` setting:

- **EMAIL**: Receives signing invitation via email
- **SMS**: Receives signing link via SMS
- **NONE**: No automatic notification (retrieve and share the signing URL yourself)

Each signer can have a different delivery method, allowing you to mix email, SMS, and manual distribution in the same document.

## Updating Signers

Signers can be updated before they sign:

```bash
PATCH /api/v1/documents/{id}/signers/{signerId}
```

<Warning>
  Once a signer has signed, their information cannot be modified.
</Warning>
