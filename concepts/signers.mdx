# Signers

Signers are individuals who need to interact with a document. Each signer has a unique role and can track their progress through the signing process.

## Signer Types

Signers can be either individuals or companies:

### INDIVIDUAL
Regular person signing on their own behalf.

### COMPANY  
Company representative signing on behalf of their organization. Requires company information.

## Signer Roles

sajn supports four different signer roles:

### SIGNER
The primary role - must sign the document for it to be completed.

```json
{
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### ORGANIZER
The person who organized the document. Receives notifications but doesn't need to sign.

### REVIEWER
Reviews the document and can leave comments, but doesn't need to sign.

### ACCEPTOR
For acceptance-type documents - accepts rather than signs the document.

## Signer Information

Each signer has the following information:

```json
{
  "type": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+46701234567",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "signingOrder": 1,
  "contactId": "contact_123"
}
```

For company signers:

```json
{
  "type": "COMPANY",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "companyName": "Acme Corp",
  "companyOrgNumber": "556123-4567",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "signingOrder": 1
}
```

### Required Fields

- **type**: Signer type (`INDIVIDUAL` or `COMPANY`)
- **name**: Signer's full name
- Either **email** OR **phone** (depending on distribution method)
- **role**: Signer role (defaults to SIGNER)

For company signers, also required:
- **companyName**: Company name
- **companyOrgNumber**: Company organization number

### Optional Fields

- **phone**: For SMS notifications
- **ssn**: Swedish personal number (required for BankID signing)
- **contactId**: Link to existing contact in sajn
- **signingOrder**: Order for sequential signing

## Signing Order

When using sequential signing (`signingOrder: "SEQUENTIAL"`), assign each signer a number:

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "Manager",
      "email": "manager@company.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Employee",
      "email": "employee@company.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

The manager must sign first before the employee can access the document.

<Note>
  For parallel signing, `signingOrder` is optional and will be ignored.
</Note>

## Signer Status

Track each signer's progress through two status fields:

### Read Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NOT_OPENED` | Signer hasn't opened the document yet |
| `OPENED` | Signer opened the document |
| `READ` | Signer read the entire document |

### Signing Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NOT_SIGNED` | Signer hasn't signed yet |
| `SIGNED` | Signer has signed the document |
| `REJECTED` | Signer rejected the document |

## Signing URLs and Tokens

Each signer gets a unique, secure URL and token:

```json
{
  "signerId": "signer_123",
  "type": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "token": "abc123...",
  "signingUrl": "https://app.sajn.se/sign/doc_123?token={abc123}...",
  "contactId": "contact_123"
}
```

<Warning>
  Never share signing URLs publicly. Each URL is tied to a specific signer and should only be sent to that individual.
</Warning>

## Linking Contacts

Signers are typically linked to contacts in your sajn account:

```json
{
  "contactId": "contact_123",
  "role": "SIGNER"
}
```

This automatically populates signer information from the contact and tracks signing history.

## BankID Integration

For BankID signatures, the signer must provide their Swedish personal number (SSN):

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "role": "SIGNER"
}
```

When sending the document, specify BankID as the signature type:

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "signatureType": "BANKID"
}
```

## Notifications

Signers receive notifications based on the distribution method:

- **EMAIL**: Receives signing invitation via email
- **SMS**: Receives signing link via SMS
- **NONE**: No automatic notification (you handle distribution)

## Updating Signers

Signers can be updated before they sign:

```bash
PATCH /api/v1/documents/{id}/signers/{signerId}
```

<Warning>
  Once a signer has signed, their information cannot be modified.
