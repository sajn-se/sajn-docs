# Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize your work in sajn. Think of them as separate folders or projects within your organization — each with its own documents, contacts, and settings.

## Why Use Workspaces?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Separate Projects" icon="folder">
    Keep different projects or clients completely separate
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Access" icon="users">
    Control which team members can access what
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stay Organized" icon="grid-2">
    Manage large volumes of documents without the clutter
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Belongs to a Workspace?

Each workspace has its own isolated set of data:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Documents | All documents created or imported |
| Contacts | People and companies you send documents to |
| Templates | Reusable document templates |
| Tags | Labels for organizing documents |
| Files | Uploaded PDFs and other files |
| Webhooks | Event notifications |
| API Tokens | Credentials for API access |

<Note>
  Data is completely isolated between workspaces. A document in one workspace cannot access contacts from another workspace.
</Note>

## Workspace Properties

Every workspace has:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Slug** | Unique identifier (e.g., `sales-team`) |
| **Name** | Display name (e.g., "Sales Team") |
| **Color** | Visual identifier in the dashboard |
| **Icon** | Optional icon for quick recognition |

## Common Use Cases

### Multiple Clients
Agencies and consultants can create a workspace for each client to keep their documents and contacts separate.

### Departments
Large organizations can have separate workspaces for HR, Legal, Sales, etc.

### Projects
Create workspaces for major projects that need their own document workflows.

## Workspace Limits by Plan

The number of workspaces you can create depends on your subscription:

| Plan | Workspaces |
|------|------------|
| BASIC / SOLO | 1 |
| TEAM | 5 |
| ENTERPRISE | Unlimited |

## Working with Workspaces

### In the Dashboard

Switch between workspaces using the workspace selector in the top navigation. Your current workspace determines which documents, contacts, and settings you see.

### Via API

When using the API, your API token is scoped to a specific workspace. All API operations affect only that workspace's data.

```bash
# Your API token determines which workspace you're working with
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WORKSPACE_TOKEN" \
  https://api.sajn.se/api/v1/documents
```
