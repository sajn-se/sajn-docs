# Signing Methods

sajn supports multiple signing methods to accommodate different use cases, security requirements, and legal needs. Each method offers a different balance between convenience and verification strength.

## SES vs AES Signatures

Before choosing a signing method, it's important to understand the two categories of electronic signatures under the eIDAS regulation:

| Type | Full Name | Legal Weight | Verification |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **SES** | Simple Electronic Signature | Legally valid, basic | Intent to sign |
| **AES** | Advanced Electronic Signature | Higher legal standing | Identity verified |

<Tip>
  For most everyday business documents, SES methods (Drawing, Click-to-Sign) provide sufficient legal validity. Use AES (BankID) for contracts requiring stronger identity verification.
</Tip>

## Quick Comparison

| Method | Type | Requirements | User Effort | Best For |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **DRAWING** | SES | None | Medium | Personal touch, visual signatures |
| **CLICK_TO_SIGN** | SES | None | Very Low | High-volume, low-friction signing |
| **BANKID** | AES | Swedish SSN | Medium | Legal contracts, identity verification |
| **MANUAL** | N/A | Physical presence | N/A | In-person signing, legacy documents |

## Drawing Signature

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <div>
    ![Drawing Signature](https://placehold.co/600x400/2563EB/white?text=Drawing+Signature)
  </div>
  <div>
    The drawing signature allows signers to create a free-hand signature using their mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen. This provides a personal, traditional feel while remaining fully digital.
  </div>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

1. Signer opens the signing link
2. Reviews the document content
3. A signature pad appears with the confirmation: "Härmed bekräftar jag följande:" (I hereby confirm the following:)
4. Signer draws their signature using mouse or touch
5. Signature is captured and applied to the document

### Requirements

- No special requirements
- Works on any device with a browser
- Touch-enabled devices provide the best experience

### Best For

- Employment contracts
- Sales agreements
- Documents where a personal signature touch is desired
- Mobile-friendly signing flows

### API Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "DRAWING"
}
```

<Note>
  The signature canvas is responsive: 288px width on desktop, 256px on mobile devices.
</Note>

## Click-to-Sign

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <div>
    ![Click to Sign](https://placehold.co/600x400/2563EB/white?text=Click+to+Sign)
  </div>
  <div>
    Click-to-Sign is the fastest signing method, requiring only two clicks to complete. Perfect for high-volume documents where speed matters more than a visual signature.
  </div>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

1. Signer opens the signing link
2. Reviews the document content
3. Clicks the "Klicka för att signera" (Click to sign) button
4. A confirmation dialog appears with a 60-second countdown
5. Signer clicks "Bekräfta signering" (Confirm signing)
6. Document is signed

### Requirements

- No special requirements
- Works on any device with a browser
- Fastest completion time

### Best For

- Terms of service acceptance
- NDAs and standard agreements
- Internal approvals
- High-volume document workflows
- Mobile-first experiences

### API Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "CLICK_TO_SIGN"
}
```

<Tip>
  Click-to-Sign creates detailed audit trail entries for both the initiation click and the confirmation, providing clear evidence of intent.
</Tip>

## BankID

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <div>
    ![BankID Signing](https://placehold.co/600x400/2563EB/white?text=BankID+Signing)
  </div>
  <div>
    BankID is Sweden's leading electronic identification system, providing cryptographically verified signatures. This is an Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) with the highest legal standing.
  </div>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

**On Desktop:**
1. Signer opens the signing link
2. Reviews the document content
3. A QR code appears on screen
4. Signer scans the QR code with their phone's BankID app
5. Confirms the signing in the BankID app
6. Document is signed with verified identity

**On Mobile:**
1. Signer opens the signing link
2. Reviews the document content
3. Clicks to open BankID app (or scans QR as fallback)
4. Confirms the signing in the BankID app
5. Returns to sajn with completed signature

### Signing States

The BankID flow progresses through these states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `checking` | Verifying BankID availability |
| `ready` | QR code displayed, waiting for scan |
| `waiting` | QR scanned, waiting for user action in app |
| `authenticating` | User confirming in BankID app |
| `verifying` | Validating the signature |
| `complete` | Signature successfully applied |

### Requirements

- Swedish personal number (SSN) - **required**
- Signer must have BankID installed on their device
- Active BankID certificate

### Best For

- Real estate transactions
- Financial agreements
- Employment contracts requiring identity verification
- Any document where verified identity is legally important
- Swedish market documents

### API Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
}
```

<Warning>
  The SSN field is required for BankID signatures. Without a valid Swedish personal number, the signing will fail.
</Warning>

## Manual Signing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <div>
    ![Manual Signing](https://placehold.co/600x400/2563EB/white?text=Manual+Signing)
  </div>
  <div>
    Manual signing is used for in-person or physical signatures. The document organizer marks the signature as complete after collecting the physical signature.
  </div>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

1. Document is created with a signer set to manual signing
2. The physical signing happens outside of sajn
3. Organizer accesses the document in sajn
4. Organizer marks the signer as having signed
5. Document flow continues with remaining signers

### Requirements

- Physical presence of signer
- Organizer action to confirm signing
- No digital signature UI shown to signer

### Best For

- In-person meetings or closings
- Imported legacy documents
- Situations where digital signing isn't possible
- Hybrid workflows mixing digital and physical signatures

### API Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "deliveryMethod": "NONE",
  "requiredSignature": "MANUAL"
}
```

<Note>
  Manual signing is typically combined with `deliveryMethod: "NONE"` since the signer doesn't need a digital signing link.
</Note>

## Choosing the Right Method

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I need the fastest signing experience">
    Use **CLICK_TO_SIGN**. It requires only two clicks and works on any device without special requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I need verified signer identity">
    Use **BANKID**. It provides cryptographic identity verification and is an Advanced Electronic Signature (AES).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want a personal, visual signature">
    Use **DRAWING**. Signers can create their own signature, providing a traditional feel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm signing in person">
    Use **MANUAL**. The organizer marks the document as signed after collecting the physical signature.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I have international signers">
    Use **DRAWING** or **CLICK_TO_SIGN**. BankID only works for signers with Swedish personal numbers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparison by Use Case

| Use Case | Recommended Method | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Employment contracts | DRAWING or BANKID | Personal touch or verified identity |
| Terms acceptance | CLICK_TO_SIGN | Minimal friction |
| Real estate | BANKID | Legal requirement for identity |
| International agreements | DRAWING | No Swedish ID required |
| Internal approvals | CLICK_TO_SIGN | Speed and convenience |
| Notarized documents | MANUAL | Requires physical presence |

## Mixing Methods

You can assign different signing methods to different signers on the same document:

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "CEO",
      "email": "ceo@company.com",
      "ssn": "197001011234",
      "requiredSignature": "BANKID",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Employee",
      "email": "employee@company.com",
      "requiredSignature": "DRAWING",
      "signingOrder": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows you to require stronger verification for key signers while keeping the process simple for others.
