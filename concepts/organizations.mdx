# Organizations

An organization is your top-level account in sajn. It represents your company or entity and contains everything you do in sajn.

## Organizations vs Workspaces

Understanding the hierarchy is simple:

```
Organization (your company)
├── Workspace A (e.g., Sales)
│   ├── Documents
│   ├── Contacts
│   └── Templates
├── Workspace B (e.g., HR)
│   ├── Documents
│   ├── Contacts
│   └── Templates
└── Workspace C (e.g., Legal)
    ├── Documents
    ├── Contacts
    └── Templates
```

  <Card title="Organization" icon="building">
    **Your company account**

    - One per company
    - Contains all workspaces
    - Manages billing and subscription
    - Controls organization-wide settings
    - Manages team members
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace" icon="folder">
    **A project or department**

    - Multiple per organization
    - Contains documents and contacts
    - Has its own templates and tags
    - Separate API tokens
    - Isolated data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Belongs Where?

| Organization Level | Workspace Level |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Team members | Documents |
| Billing & subscription | Contacts |
| Organization name & branding | Templates |
| SSO settings | Tags |
| Audit logs | Files |
| | Webhooks |
| | API tokens |

<Note>
  Team members are invited at the organization level, then given access to specific workspaces.
</Note>

## How It Works in Practice

### Example: Marketing Agency

A marketing agency called "Creative Co" might set up sajn like this:

**Organization:** Creative Co
- **Workspace:** Client A — contracts and NDAs for Client A
- **Workspace:** Client B — agreements for Client B
- **Workspace:** Internal — employee contracts and policies

Each client's documents stay separate, but the agency manages billing and team members in one place.

### Example: Growing Startup

A startup might start simple and grow:

1. **Day 1:** One organization, one workspace (default)
2. **Month 6:** Add a "Sales" workspace for customer contracts
3. **Year 1:** Add "HR" workspace for employee documents

## Managing Your Organization

### Organization Settings

Access organization settings to:
- Update company name and branding
- Manage subscription and billing
- View organization-wide audit logs
- Configure SSO (Enterprise plans)

### Team Members

Invite team members at the organization level, then assign them to workspaces:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access to everything, including billing |
| **Admin** | Can manage workspaces and members |
| **Member** | Access to assigned workspaces only |

## One Organization, Multiple Workspaces

Most companies need just **one organization** with **multiple workspaces**:

<Tip>
  You only need multiple organizations if you're managing completely separate legal entities with separate billing.
