# Identity Verification with sajn ID

Use sajn ID to verify customer identities using Swedish BankID before granting access to services or completing transactions.

## Overview

sajn ID provides two verification methods:

- **SSN-based**: Verifies identity AND Swedish personal number
- **Name-based**: Verifies identity and name match without requiring SSN

## Quick Start

Create and send a verification request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/sajn-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "channel": "EMAIL",
    "sendImmediately": true
  }'
```

The user receives an email with a verification link and completes BankID authentication.

## Use Cases

### Customer Onboarding

Verify identity during account creation:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "reference": "customer_signup_2024_001",
  "note": "New customer registration",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

### Age Verification

Verify someone is 18+ without collecting SSN:

```json
{
  "fullName": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "reference": "age_verification",
  "note": "18+ age check for alcohol purchase",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

### Pre-Contract Verification

Verify identity before allowing document signing:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "contactId": "contact_123",
  "reference": "pre_contract_verification",
  "note": "ID check before loan agreement",
  "sendImmediately": true
}
```

## SSN-Based vs Name-Based

### When to Use SSN-Based

Use SSN-based verification when you:
- Need to verify the exact person (e.g., financial services)
- Are legally required to collect and verify SSN
- Need to match against government databases

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "ssn": "197001011234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL"
}
```

### When to Use Name-Based

Use name-based verification when you:
- Only need to verify identity, not specific SSN
- Want to respect privacy (GDPR-friendly)
- Just need age verification

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL"
}
```

## Verification Flow

1. **Create verification** via API
2. **User receives link** via email or SMS
3. **User clicks link** and opens verification page
4. **User authenticates** with BankID app
5. **Verification completes** and you receive webhook notification
6. **Retrieve results** via API

## Checking Verification Status

Poll for status updates:

```bash
GET /api/v1/sajn-id/{verificationId}
```

Response when pending:

```json
{
  "id": "verify_123",
  "status": "SENT",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "usedAt": null
}
```

Response when completed:

```json
{
  "id": "verify_123",
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "usedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "completionData": {
      "user": {
        "personalNumber": "197001011234",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "givenName": "John",
        "surname": "Doe"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Webhook Integration

Receive real-time notifications:

```json
{
  "event": "SAJN_ID_VERIFIED",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "verificationId": "verify_123",
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "status": "VERIFIED",
    "reference": "customer_signup_2024_001"
  }
}
```

## Linking to Contacts

Link verifications to existing contacts for audit trail:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "contactId": "contact_123"
}
```

This creates a permanent record in the contact's history.

## Implementation Example

Complete verification workflow:

```javascript
// Step 1: Create verification
const verification = await fetch('https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/sajn-id', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    fullName: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    channel: 'EMAIL',
    reference: 'signup_123',
    sendImmediately: true
  })
}).then(r => r.json());

// Step 2: Poll for completion (or use webhooks)
const checkStatus = async (verificationId) => {
  const status = await fetch(
    `https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/sajn-id/${verificationId}`,
    {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
    }
  ).then(r => r.json());

  if (status.status === 'VERIFIED') {
    // Verification successful
    console.log('Verified:', status.data);
    return true;
  } else if (status.status === 'FAILED' || status.status === 'EXPIRED') {
    // Verification failed
    console.log('Failed:', status.failureReason);
    return false;
  }

  // Still pending, check again later
  return null;
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Verification Not Received

- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify email/phone is correct
- Check verification wasn't already used
- Look for delivery failures in dashboard

### BankID Failed

Common reasons:
- User canceled authentication
- BankID app not responding
- Wrong personal number provided
- BankID account issues

The user can retry by clicking the link again.

### Name Mismatch

If name-based verification fails due to mismatch:
- Double-check spelling in request
- Ask user for their exact registered name
- Consider SSN-based verification for certainty
