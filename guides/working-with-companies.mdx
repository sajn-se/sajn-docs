# Working with Companies

Companies in sajn represent organizations that your contacts belong to. When signing documents on behalf of a company, the signer acts as a representative of that organization.

## When to Use Company Signers

Use company signers when:

- The signer is signing on behalf of their employer or organization
- You need to track which company a contract is with
- Legal agreements require company representation
- You want to organize contacts by their organizations

## Creating Company Records

Create a company with its basic information:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/companies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corporation AB",
    "orgNumber": "556123-4567",
    "country": "Sweden"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "company": {
    "id": "company_xyz789",
    "name": "Acme Corporation AB",
    "orgNumber": "556123-4567",
    "country": "Sweden",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Company Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Official company name |
| `orgNumber` | No | Organization number (e.g., Swedish organisationsnummer) |
| `country` | No | Country where the company is registered |
| `externalId` | No | Your system's identifier |

## Swedish Organization Numbers

Swedish organization numbers (organisationsnummer) follow a specific format:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `XXXXXX-XXXX` | `556123-4567` | Standard format with hyphen |
| `XXXXXXXXXX` | `5561234567` | Without hyphen (also accepted) |

<Note>
  sajn validates Swedish organization numbers for correct format and checksum. Invalid numbers will be rejected.
</Note>

## Company Representatives

When a person signs on behalf of a company, they act as a representative. This is different from an individual signer.

### Adding a Company Signer to a Document

When creating a document, specify `type: "COMPANY"` for the signer:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Partnership Agreement",
    "type": "SIGNABLE",
    "signers": [
      {
        "type": "COMPANY",
        "name": "Erik Eriksson",
        "email": "erik@acme.se",
        "companyName": "Acme Corporation AB",
        "companyOrgNumber": "556123-4567",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Using a Contact Linked to a Company

If you have a contact already linked to a company, reference them directly:

```json
{
  "name": "Vendor Agreement",
  "type": "SIGNABLE",
  "signers": [
    {
      "contactId": "contact_abc123",
      "type": "COMPANY",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1,
      "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
      "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
    }
  ]
}
```

The signer inherits both personal information and company details from the contact record.

## Company Signer vs Individual Signer

| Aspect | Individual Signer | Company Signer |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Signs as | Themselves | Representative of company |
| Document shows | Personal name only | Name + company name |
| Legal binding | Personal responsibility | Company responsibility |
| Use case | Personal contracts | Business agreements |

<Tip>
  For contracts where both personal and company responsibility apply (e.g., CEO signing with personal guarantee), you may need the same person as two separate signers.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify organization numbers">
    Always verify Swedish organization numbers before creating company records. Invalid numbers will be rejected by the API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming">
    Use the official company name as registered. This ensures consistency across documents and makes searching easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Link all employees">
    When working with a company regularly, create contacts for all key stakeholders and link them to the company record.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include company roles">
    Always set `companyRole` when linking contacts to companies. This helps identify who has signing authority.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use BankID for company signers">
    In Sweden, BankID provides the strongest verification for company representatives, as it verifies their personal identity.
  </Accordion>
