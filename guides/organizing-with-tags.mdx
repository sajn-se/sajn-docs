# Organizing with Tags

Tags help you categorize and organize documents across your organization. By assigning tags to documents, you can quickly filter, search, and manage large volumes of agreements.

## Why Use Tags?

As your document volume grows, finding specific documents becomes challenging. Tags solve this by:

- **Categorizing documents** by type, client, department, or status
- **Enabling quick filtering** to find related documents
- **Improving workflow** by grouping documents logically
- **Supporting reporting** by allowing aggregate views

## Creating Tags

Create tags with a name and optional color for visual organization:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Employment",
    "color": "#22C55E"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "tag": {
    "id": "tag_abc123",
    "name": "Employment",
    "color": "#22C55E",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Tag Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Display name for the tag (unique within organization) |
| `color` | No | Hex color code for visual identification (e.g., `#22C55E`) |

### Suggested Colors

| Color | Hex Code | Suggested Use |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Green | `#22C55E` | Completed, approved |
| Blue | `#3B82F6` | In progress, active |
| Yellow | `#EAB308` | Pending review, attention needed |
| Red | `#EF4444` | Urgent, rejected |
| Purple | `#A855F7` | Special handling |
| Gray | `#6B7280` | Archived, inactive |

## Adding Tags to Documents

### When Creating a Document

Include tag IDs in the document creation request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Employment Contract - Anna Andersson",
    "type": "SIGNABLE",
    "tags": ["tag_abc123", "tag_def456"]
  }'
```

### Adding Tags to Existing Documents

Add a tag to a document that already exists:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents/doc_123/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tagId": "tag_abc123"
  }'
```

### Removing Tags from Documents

Remove a tag from a document:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents/doc_123/tags/tag_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Filtering Documents by Tags

</Frame>

### Using the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Documents list
2. Click the **Filter** button
3. Select one or more tags
4. The list updates to show only matching documents

### Using the API

Filter documents by tag when listing:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents?tagId=tag_abc123&page=1&perPage=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  You can filter by multiple tags by including multiple `tagId` parameters. Documents matching any of the specified tags will be returned.
</Note>

## Tag Management

### Listing All Tags

Retrieve all tags in your organization:

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": "tag_abc123",
      "name": "Employment",
      "color": "#22C55E"
    },
    {
      "id": "tag_def456",
      "name": "NDA",
      "color": "#3B82F6"
    },
    {
      "id": "tag_ghi789",
      "name": "Urgent",
      "color": "#EF4444"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Updating Tags

Change a tag's name or color:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/tags/tag_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Employment Contracts",
    "color": "#16A34A"
  }'
```

<Tip>
  Updating a tag automatically updates its appearance on all documents that have it assigned.
</Tip>

## Organization Strategies

### By Document Type

Create tags for each type of document you handle:

| Tag | Color | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Employment | Green | Employment contracts and offers |
| NDA | Blue | Non-disclosure agreements |
| Vendor | Purple | Vendor and supplier contracts |
| Client | Yellow | Client agreements |
| Internal | Gray | Internal policies and approvals |

### By Client or Project

For project-based work, create tags per client or project:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Client: Acme Corp | All documents for Acme Corporation |
| Project: Website 2024 | Documents related to website project |
| Deal: Q1 Expansion | M&A or deal-specific documents |

### By Status or Priority

Track document lifecycle with status tags:

| Tag | Color | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Urgent | Red | Requires immediate attention |
| Review Needed | Yellow | Awaiting internal review |
| Ready to Send | Blue | Approved and ready for signing |
| Archived | Gray | Completed and filed |

### By Department

Organize by internal teams:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| HR | Human resources documents |
| Legal | Legal agreements and contracts |
| Sales | Sales contracts and quotes |
| Finance | Financial agreements |

<Warning>
  Avoid creating too many tags. A smaller set of well-defined tags is more useful than hundreds of rarely-used ones.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Define a tagging strategy">
    Before creating tags, decide on your organization's tagging strategy. Document which tags to use and when, so everyone applies them consistently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming">
    Establish naming conventions for tags. For example, always prefix client tags with "Client:" or project tags with "Project:".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit the number of tags">
    Keep your tag list manageable. Aim for 10-20 well-defined tags rather than creating a new tag for every scenario.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use colors meaningfully">
    Assign colors based on meaning (red for urgent, green for complete) rather than aesthetics. This makes visual scanning faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review and clean up regularly">
    Periodically review your tags. Remove or merge tags that are rarely used or have become redundant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tag documents consistently">
    Make tagging part of your document creation workflow. Tag documents when creating them, not as an afterthought.
  </Accordion>
