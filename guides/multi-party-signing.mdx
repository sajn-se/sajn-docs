# Multi-Party Signing Workflows

Many agreements require signatures from multiple parties. sajn supports flexible signing workflows, from simple parallel signing to complex sequential approval chains.

## Understanding Signing Orders

sajn offers three approaches for multi-party signing:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Parallel** | Everyone signs at the same time | NDAs, simple contracts |
| **Sequential** | One after another in order | Approval chains, escalations |
| **Mixed** | Some parallel, some sequential | Complex workflows |

## Parallel Signing

In parallel signing, all signers receive the document at the same time and can sign in any order.

### Configuration

Set all signers to the same `signingOrder`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Non-Disclosure Agreement",
    "type": "SIGNABLE",
    "documentMeta": {
      "signingOrder": "PARALLEL"
    },
    "signers": [
      {
        "name": "Anna Andersson",
        "email": "anna@company.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      },
      {
        "name": "Erik Eriksson",
        "email": "erik@partner.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### When to Use Parallel Signing

- **NDAs** where both parties need to agree
- **Simple contracts** with equal parties
- **Time-sensitive documents** where speed matters
- **Multi-party agreements** without dependency requirements

<Tip>
  Parallel signing is faster because signers don't wait for each other. Use it when there's no requirement for a specific signing sequence.
</Tip>

## Sequential Signing

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/signing-sequential.png" alt="Diagram showing sequential signing with numbered steps" />
</Frame>

In sequential signing, signers receive the document one at a time in a specified order. The next signer only receives the document after the previous one has signed.

### Configuration

Set incrementing `signingOrder` values:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Employment Contract",
    "type": "SIGNABLE",
    "documentMeta": {
      "signingOrder": "SEQUENTIAL"
    },
    "signers": [
      {
        "name": "Anna Andersson",
        "email": "anna@company.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "DRAWING"
      },
      {
        "name": "Maria Johansson",
        "email": "maria@company.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 2,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      },
      {
        "name": "Erik Eriksson",
        "email": "erik@company.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 3,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Signing Flow

1. **Step 1**: Anna receives the document and signs
2. **Step 2**: After Anna signs, Maria receives the document
3. **Step 3**: After Maria signs, Erik receives the document
4. **Completed**: All three have signed

### When to Use Sequential Signing

- **Approval chains** where manager approval is needed first
- **Hierarchical signatures** (employee → manager → executive)
- **Counter-signatures** where one party must sign first
- **Legal requirements** for specific signing order

## Mixed Workflows

For complex scenarios, combine parallel and sequential signing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Partnership Agreement",
    "type": "SIGNABLE",
    "documentMeta": {
      "signingOrder": "SEQUENTIAL"
    },
    "signers": [
      {
        "name": "Anna Andersson",
        "email": "anna@company-a.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      },
      {
        "name": "Erik Eriksson",
        "email": "erik@company-a.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      },
      {
        "name": "Maria Johansson",
        "email": "maria@company-b.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 2,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      },
      {
        "name": "Johan Svensson",
        "email": "johan@company-b.se",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 2,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Signing Flow

1. **Step 1** (Parallel): Anna and Erik from Company A sign simultaneously
2. **Step 2** (Parallel): After both sign, Maria and Johan from Company B sign simultaneously
3. **Completed**: All four have signed

<Note>
  Signers with the same `signingOrder` value sign in parallel. The next order group only receives the document when all previous signers have completed.
</Note>

## Tracking Progress

### Document Status

Track overall document progress:

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents/doc_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response shows signing status:

```json
{
  "document": {
    "id": "doc_123",
    "name": "Employment Contract",
    "status": "SENT",
    "signers": [
      {
        "signerId": "signer_1",
        "name": "Anna Andersson",
        "status": "SIGNED",
        "signedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
      },
      {
        "signerId": "signer_2",
        "name": "Maria Johansson",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "signedAt": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Signer Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Waiting for earlier signers (sequential) |
| `NOTIFIED` | Document sent, awaiting signature |
| `OPENED` | Signer has viewed the document |
| `SIGNED` | Signer has completed signing |
| `REJECTED` | Signer has declined to sign |

### Webhook Notifications

Receive real-time updates for each signing event:

```json
{
  "event": "DOCUMENT_SIGNED",
  "data": {
    "documentId": "doc_123",
    "signerId": "signer_1",
    "signerName": "Anna Andersson",
    "signedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "remainingSigners": 2
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Manager Approval Before Employee

Employee signs first, then manager approves:

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "Anna Andersson",
      "email": "anna@company.se",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Erik Manager",
      "email": "erik@company.se",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Counterparties

Your company signs first, then the client:

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "Your CEO",
      "email": "ceo@yourcompany.se",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Client Representative",
      "email": "contact@client.se",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Witness Signatures

Main parties sign, then witnesses attest:

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "Party A",
      "email": "party-a@example.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Party B",
      "email": "party-b@example.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Witness 1",
      "email": "witness1@example.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "Witness 2",
      "email": "witness2@example.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Board Resolution

All board members must sign:

```json
{
  "documentMeta": {
    "signingOrder": "PARALLEL"
  },
  "signers": [
    { "name": "Board Member 1", "signingOrder": 1 },
    { "name": "Board Member 2", "signingOrder": 1 },
    { "name": "Board Member 3", "signingOrder": 1 },
    { "name": "Board Member 4", "signingOrder": 1 },
    { "name": "Board Member 5", "signingOrder": 1 }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consider signer availability">
    For sequential signing, consider whether signers will be available. A single unavailable signer blocks the entire chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use parallel when possible">
    Parallel signing is faster and reduces bottlenecks. Only use sequential when there's a business requirement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set appropriate expiration">
    For multi-party documents, allow extra time for all parties to sign. Consider longer expiration periods.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure reminders">
    Enable automatic reminders to keep the signing process moving, especially for sequential workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle rejections gracefully">
    If any signer rejects, the document is rejected. Have a process for handling rejections and restarting if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track with webhooks">
    Use webhooks to monitor signing progress and take action when documents are signed, rejected, or stalled.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
