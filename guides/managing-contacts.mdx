# Managing Contacts

Contacts are reusable records of individuals you frequently send documents to. By managing contacts effectively, you can speed up document creation and maintain consistent signer information across your organization.

## Why Use Contacts?

Instead of manually entering signer details each time you create a document, contacts allow you to:

- **Save time** by reusing stored information
- **Reduce errors** with pre-validated contact details
- **Track history** across all documents a person has signed
- **Stay organized** by linking contacts to companies

## Creating Contacts

### Individual Contacts

Create a contact with the essential information for document delivery:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Anna",
    "lastName": "Andersson",
    "email": "anna@example.com",
    "phone": "+46701234567"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "contact": {
    "id": "contact_abc123",
    "firstName": "Anna",
    "lastName": "Andersson",
    "email": "anna@example.com",
    "phone": "+46701234567",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Contact Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `firstName` | Yes | Contact's first name |
| `lastName` | Yes | Contact's last name |
| `email` | No | Email address for document delivery |
| `phone` | No | Phone number for SMS delivery |
| `ssn` | No | Swedish personal number (personnummer) |
| `companyId` | No | Link to an existing company |
| `companyRole` | No | Role within the company (e.g., "CEO", "CFO") |
| `externalId` | No | Your system's identifier for integration |

<Tip>
  At least one of `email` or `phone` is recommended so documents can be delivered to the contact.
</Tip>

### Contacts with Company Association

Link a contact to an existing company:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Erik",
  "lastName": "Eriksson",
  "email": "erik@acme.se",
  "companyId": "company_xyz789",
  "companyRole": "CFO"
}
```

## Searching and Filtering Contacts

### List All Contacts

Retrieve a paginated list of all contacts in your organization:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts?page=1&perPage=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Search by Specific Criteria

Search for contacts by email, phone, or external ID:

```bash
# Search by email
curl -X GET "https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts/search?email=anna@example.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Search by phone
curl -X GET "https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts/search?phone=+46701234567" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Search by external ID
curl -X GET "https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts/search?externalId=customer_456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  All searches are exact matches scoped to your organization. The search returns an array of matching contacts, or an empty array if no matches are found.
</Note>

## Linking Contacts to Signers

When creating a document, reference an existing contact instead of manually entering signer details:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Service Agreement",
    "type": "SIGNABLE",
    "signers": [
      {
        "contactId": "contact_abc123",
        "role": "SIGNER",
        "signingOrder": 1,
        "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
        "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The signer automatically inherits the contact's name, email, and phone number. You can still override specific fields if needed:

```json
{
  "contactId": "contact_abc123",
  "email": "anna.work@example.com",
  "role": "SIGNER",
  "signingOrder": 1,
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "DRAWING"
}
```

## Updating Contacts

Update an existing contact's information:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts/contact_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "anna.new@example.com",
    "phone": "+46709876543"
  }'
```

<Warning>
  Updating a contact does not affect existing document signers. Changes only apply to new documents created with this contact.
</Warning>

## Deleting Contacts

Remove a contact from your organization:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts/contact_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  Deleted contacts are soft-deleted to preserve historical data. They are hidden from lists, but existing document references remain valid for audit purposes.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check for duplicates before creating">
    Use the search endpoint to check if a contact already exists before creating a new one. This prevents duplicate records and maintains data quality.

    ```bash
    # Check if contact exists before creating
    curl -X GET "https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/contacts/search?email=anna@example.com" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use external IDs for integration">
    When integrating with a CRM or other system, always set `externalId` to your system's identifier. This makes syncing and lookups straightforward.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep contact information current">
    Regularly update contact details, especially email addresses and phone numbers, to ensure successful document delivery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize with companies">
    For B2B scenarios, create companies and link contacts to them. This improves organization and makes it easier to find all contacts from a specific organization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate data before creation">
    Ensure email addresses are valid and phone numbers are in international format (e.g., +46701234567) before creating contacts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
