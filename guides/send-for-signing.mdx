# Sending Documents for Signing

Learn how to send documents to signers and manage the signing workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before sending a document:

1. Document must be in `DRAFT` status
2. At least one signer must be added with:
   - `deliveryMethod` configured (EMAIL, SMS, or NONE)
   - `requiredSignature` configured (DRAWING, BANKID, CLICK_TO_SIGN, or MANUAL)
3. Signers must have valid email addresses (for EMAIL delivery) or phone numbers (for SMS delivery)

## Basic Send

Send a document to signers:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents/{documentId}/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

The send endpoint triggers delivery based on each signer's individual `deliveryMethod` setting.

## Adding a Custom Message

Include a personal message in the signing invitation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents/{documentId}/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customMessage": "Hi, please review and sign the updated employment contract. Let me know if you have any questions!"
  }'
```

## Per-Signer Delivery and Signature Settings

Delivery method and signature type are configured per-signer when adding them to the document, not at send time. This allows different signers to receive invitations through different channels and use different signature types.

### Example: Mixed Delivery Methods

```json
{
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
      "requiredSignature": "DRAWING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jane Manager",
      "phone": "+46701234567",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "deliveryMethod": "SMS",
      "requiredSignature": "BANKID",
      "twoStepVerification": "SMS_BEFORE_SIGNING"
    },
    {
      "name": "External Reviewer",
      "email": "reviewer@external.com",
      "role": "REVIEWER",
      "deliveryMethod": "NONE"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- John receives an email with a drawing signature
- Jane receives an SMS with BankID + SMS verification before signing
- The external reviewer doesn't receive automatic delivery (use signing URL directly)

### Delivery Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EMAIL` | Signing invitation sent via email |
| `SMS` | Signing link sent via SMS (requires phone number) |
| `NONE` | No automatic delivery - retrieve signing URL manually |

### Signature Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DRAWING` | Free-hand signature drawing (SES) |
| `BANKID` | Swedish BankID electronic signature (AES) - requires SSN |
| `CLICK_TO_SIGN` | Simple click-to-sign (SES) |
| `MANUAL` | For in-person signing |

### Two-Step Verification

For additional security, enable SMS verification before signing:

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "requiredSignature": "DRAWING",
  "twoStepVerification": "SMS_BEFORE_SIGNING"
}
```

This sends an SMS code that the signer must enter before they can sign.

## Retrieving Signing URLs

For signers with `deliveryMethod: "NONE"`, or when you need to share the signing URL directly:

```bash
GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}/signers/{signerId}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "signer_123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "token": "abc123...",
  "signingUrl": "https://app.sajn.se/sign/doc_123?token=abc123..."
}
```

<Note>
  Each time you retrieve a signing URL, an audit log entry is created. Only fetch signing URLs when you need to share them with signers.
</Note>

## Signing Workflows

### Parallel Signing

All signers can sign simultaneously (default):

```json
{
  "documentMeta": {
    "signingOrder": "PARALLEL"
  }
}
```

All signers receive invitations immediately when the document is sent.

### Sequential Signing

Signers must sign in order:

```json
{
  "documentMeta": {
    "signingOrder": "SEQUENTIAL"
  },
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "Manager",
      "email": "manager@company.com",
      "signingOrder": 1,
      "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
      "requiredSignature": "BANKID"
    },
    {
      "name": "Employee",
      "email": "employee@company.com",
      "signingOrder": 2,
      "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
      "requiredSignature": "DRAWING"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only the first signer receives the invitation. Others receive theirs after the previous signer completes.

## Tracking Status

After sending, monitor document and signer status:

```bash
GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}
```

Response shows individual signer progress:

```json
{
  "id": "doc_123",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "readStatus": "OPENED",
      "signingStatus": "NOT_SIGNED",
      "signedAt": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Jane Manager",
      "readStatus": "READ",
      "signingStatus": "SIGNED",
      "signedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Resending Invitations

If a signer didn't receive or lost their invitation, update and resend:

```bash
# Update signer email if needed
PATCH /api/v1/documents/{docId}/signers/{signerId}

# Resend the document
POST /api/v1/documents/{docId}/send
```

## Document Completion

When all signers have signed:

1. Document status changes to `COMPLETED`
2. Final sealed document is generated
3. All parties receive completion notification (if configured)
4. Webhooks fire `DOCUMENT_COMPLETED` event

Download the completed document:

```bash
GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}/download
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test before sending">
    Use `deliveryMethod: "NONE"` on signers to get signing URLs for testing before sending to real signers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear instructions">
    Always include a custom message explaining what the document is and why it needs signing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sequential for approvals">
    Use sequential signing when manager approval is needed before employee signatures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set expiration">
    Set reasonable expiration dates (7-30 days) to maintain urgency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor progress">
    Use webhooks or polling to track signing progress and send reminders if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Signer Didn't Receive Email

1. Check spam/junk folders
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Update email address if needed
4. Resend the document

### Wrong Signing Order

If you need to change signing order:

1. Cancel the current document
2. Create a new document with correct order
3. Send the new document

### Document Stuck in SENDING

If document is stuck in `SENDING` status, contact support at hej@sajn.se.
