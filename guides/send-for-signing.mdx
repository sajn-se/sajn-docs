# Sending Documents for Signing

Learn how to send documents to signers and manage the signing workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before sending a document:

1. Document must be in `DRAFT` status
2. At least one signer must be added
3. Signers must have valid email addresses (for EMAIL) or phone numbers (for SMS)

## Basic Send

Send a document via email with default settings:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.sajn.se/api/v1/documents/{documentId}/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
    "signatureType": "DRAWING"
  }'
```

## Delivery Methods

### Email Distribution

Send signing invitations via email:

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "signatureType": "DRAWING",
  "customMessage": "Please sign this document at your earliest convenience."
}
```

### SMS Distribution

Send signing links via SMS (requires phone numbers on signers):

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "SMS",
  "signatureType": "DRAWING"
}
```

### No Automatic Distribution

Get signing URLs without sending notifications:

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "NONE",
  "signatureType": "DRAWING"
}
```

Use this when you want to distribute URLs through your own channels.

## Signature Types

### Drawing Signature

Free-hand signature drawing:

```json
{
  "signatureType": "DRAWING"
}
```

### BankID Signature

Swedish BankID electronic signature (requires SSN on signers):

```json
{
  "signatureType": "BANKID"
}
```

### Manual Signature

For in-person signing:

```json
{
  "signatureType": "MANUAL"
}
```

## Custom Messages

Add a personal message to the signing invitation:

```json
{
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "signatureType": "DRAWING",
  "customMessage": "Hi John, please review and sign the updated employment contract. Let me know if you have any questions!"
}
```

## Signing Workflows

### Parallel Signing

All signers can sign simultaneously (default):

```json
// Document metadata
{
  "documentMeta": {
    "signingOrder": "PARALLEL"
  }
}

// When sending
{
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "signatureType": "DRAWING"
}
```

All signers receive invitations immediately.

### Sequential Signing

Signers must sign in order:

```json
// Document metadata (set when creating/updating document)
{
  "documentMeta": {
    "signingOrder": "SEQUENTIAL"
  }
}

// Signers with order
[
  {
    "name": "Manager",
    "email": "manager@company.com",
    "signingOrder": 1
  },
  {
    "name": "Employee",
    "email": "employee@company.com",
    "signingOrder": 2
  }
]

// When sending
{
  "deliveryMethod": "EMAIL",
  "signatureType": "DRAWING"
}
```

Only the first signer receives the invitation. Others receive theirs after the previous signer completes.

## Tracking Status

After sending, monitor document and signer status:

```bash
GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}
```

Response shows individual signer progress:

```json
{
  "id": "doc_123",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "signers": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "readStatus": "OPENED",
      "signingStatus": "NOT_SIGNED",
      "signedAt": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Jane Manager",
      "readStatus": "READ",
      "signingStatus": "SIGNED",
      "signedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Resending Invitations

If a signer didn't receive or lost their invitation, update and resend:

```bash
# Update signer email if needed
PATCH /api/v1/documents/{docId}/signers/{signerId}

# Resend the document
POST /api/v1/documents/{docId}/send
```

## Document Completion

When all signers have signed:

1. Document status changes to `COMPLETED`
2. Final sealed document is generated
3. All parties receive completion notification (if configured)
4. Webhooks fire `DOCUMENT_COMPLETED` event

Download the completed document:

```bash
GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}/download
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test before sending">
    Use `deliveryMethod: "NONE"` to get signing URLs for testing before sending to real signers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear instructions">
    Always include a custom message explaining what the document is and why it needs signing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sequential for approvals">
    Use sequential signing when manager approval is needed before employee signatures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set expiration">
    Set reasonable expiration dates (7-30 days) to maintain urgency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor progress">
    Use webhooks or polling to track signing progress and send reminders if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

1. Check spam/junk folders
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Update email address if needed
4. Resend the document

### Wrong Signing Order
